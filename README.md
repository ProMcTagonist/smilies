# Smilies

This is an emoticon pack intended for use in [qTox](github.com/tux3/qtox).

Its goals are to satisfy my personal pickiness about emoticon sets. It skins many emoji for compatibility, and also skins a great deal of text emoticons that people I know use. I dislike :emoticons: because stickers should be used for this concept instead.

The cat_*.svg files are taken and modified from [the Android color emoji set](https://code.google.com/p/noto/source/browse/#git%2Fcolor_emoji) 
which is under the Apache 2.0 license. 

I also used the hearts from cat_hearts.svg everywhere you see hearts.

The rest are based on [Krepa's work](https://github.com/tux3/qTox/tree/master/smileys/krepa098) and are GPLv3ed.

Licensing is being worked on and GitHub is where everyone can be reached easily don't sue me yet


## Installing

```
cd ~/.kde/share/emoticons 
git clone https://github.com/promctagonist/smilies
```
Restart qTox and then select smilies-master from Settings > General > Theme.


## Contributing

If you'd like to help out, take a look at TODO and do those. We also need _8eyes, _angry, _wink, and _xeyes versions of everything that those work with. And emoticons.xml needs organization.

You should also make issues about any emoticons you'd like to see here. I'm not doing non-sideways ones/kaomoji anytime soon though.

Note: I try to keep them looking consistent by reusing elements and using Paste in Place (ctrl+alt+v in Inkscape). 

If you like to edit svgs with a text editor i'm sorry
