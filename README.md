This is an emoticon pack intended for use in [qTox](github.com/tux3/qtox).

The cat_*.svg files are taken and modified from [the Android color emoji set](https://code.google.com/p/noto/source/browse/#git%2Fcolor_emoji) 
which is under the Apache 2.0 license. This is the modification notice.
The Apache 2.0 license can be found in LICENSE. Licensing is being worked on and GitHub is where everyone can be reached easily don't sue me yet

I also used the hearts from cat_hearts.svg everywhere else you see hearts.

The rest are based on [Krepa's work](https://github.com/tux3/qTox/tree/master/smileys/krepa098).

I used many many bits from raw.svg.
