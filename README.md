This is an emoticon pack intended for use in [qTox](github.com/tux3/qtox).

The cat_*.svg files are modified from 
https://code.google.com/p/noto/source/browse/#git%2Fcolor_emoji 
which is under the Apache 2.0 license. This is the modification notice.
The Apache 2.0 license can be found in LICENSE.

I also used the hearts from cat_hearts.svg everywhere else you see hearts.

The rest are based on [Krepa's work](https://github.com/tux3/qTox/tree/master/smileys/krepa098).

I used many many bits from raw.svg.
